## 🚀 About This Repository

**rust-solana-playground** is my personal learning lab where I practice and experiment with  
**Rust**, **Solana**, and **Anchor** concepts on a daily basis.

This repository focuses on **core blockchain fundamentals**, not large projects.
Each snippet is small, intentional, and designed to strengthen real-world understanding.

> ⚠️ This repo is for learning and exploration.  
> Production-ready projects are maintained in separate repositories.
